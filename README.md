Wearing a safety helmet is important in construction and manufacturing industrial activities to avoid unpleasant situations. This safety compliance can be ensured by developing an automatic helmet detection system using various computer vision and deep learning approaches. Developing a deep learning-based helmet detection model usually requires an enormous amount of training data. However, there are very few public safety helmet datasets available in the literature, in which most of them are not entirly labeled, and the labeled one contains fewer classes. This paper presents the SHEL5K (Safety HELmet dataset with 5K images) dataset, an enhanced version of the SHD dataset. The proposed dataset consists of completely labeled six various classes (*helmet*, *head*, *head with helmet*, *person with helmet*, *person without helmet*, and *face*). 
The proposed dataset is tested on multiple state-of-the-art object detection models, i.e. YOLOv3 (YOLOv3, YOLOv3-tiny, and YOLOv3- SPP), YOLOv4 (YOLOv4 and YOLOv4\textsubscript{pacsp-x-mish}), YOLOv5-P5 (YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, and YOLOv5x), Faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster-RCNN) with Inception V2 architecture, and YOLOR. The experimental results from the various models on the proposed dataset are compared and showed improvement in mAPs (mean average precision). The SHEL5K dataset has the advantage over other safety helmet datasets as it contains fewer images with better labels and more classes, making helmet detection more accurate.
