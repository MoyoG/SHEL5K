Wearing a safety helmet is important in construction and manufacturing industrial activities to avoid unpleasant situations. This safety compliance can be ensured by developing an automatic helmet detection system using various computer vision and deep learning approaches. Developing a deep learning-based helmet detection model usually requires an enormous amount of training data. However, there are very few public safety helmet datasets available in the literature, in which most of them are not entirly labeled, and the labeled one contains fewer classes. This paper presents the SHEL5K (Safety HELmet dataset with 5K images) dataset, an enhanced version of the SHD dataset.
